                  What's new in each version of Interchange
                       (since the version 5.0 branch)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interchange 5.0.1 not yet released.

Core
----

* Disallow [ and < in page names when setting MV_PAGE and MV_PREV_PAGE
  variables.

* Prevent login information from getting re-saved on a session cancel.

* Define a set of CGI keys that we don't want to save to disk, as
  @Global::HideCGI.

* Don't show sensitive (i.e. @Global::HideCGI) CGI variables in a dump.
  This allows saving a session to disk for diagnositic purposes in case
  of order failure.

* Allow [dump no-cgi=1 no-session=1 no-env=1] to finetune dump.

* Tolerate leading whitespace in query in Vend::Form.

Admin
-----

* Fix bug where affiliate reports don't filter based on that.  

* Make reports with no specified end_date work.

* Fix missing relocation variables in Vend::Table::Editor found by Paul
  Vinciguerra.

Foundation
----------

* Remove unmatched </FORM> from cart_display component.

Debian
------

* Add libhtml-parser-perl to Build-Depends to keep HTML::Entities
  module out of the package (Closes: #224435, thanks to Henrik Holmboe
  <elements@hack.se> for the bug report)
