Interchange 4.7.0

  * Added ability to cascade mv_click statements, i.e.

    [set delete]
        deleterecords=1
        item_id=[item-code]
        mv_click=db_maintenance
    [/set]
    
    [page   href="@@MV_PAGE@@"
            form="
                mv_action=back
                mv_click=db_maintenance
            "]Delete this</A>

  * Added "clone item" to item pages. Allows you to clone an
    existing item for purposes of adding new ones.

  * Re-instituted multiple-table deletes for deleting an item. It
    will look in __UI_ITEM_TABLES__ and delete records

  * Added clone_set and clone_row primitives in Data modules.
    Allows you to copy a record except for certain fields.

  * Added [item-options] tag which automatically finds and
    presents options based on the options table. The table
    name is settable based on Variable MV_OPTION_TABLE. Fields
    can be remapped with MV_OPTION_TABLE_MAP.

  * Now can use "variant" items which are based on a base
    SKU but set in an options table (same as the one for
    [item-options]). Changed behavior of [item-field ...]
    to look in the code first, then the base SKU, for the
    relevant product databases. [item-data ...] always works
    off of the relevant base SKU.

  * Price looks at variant code first, then the base SKU if
    that is zero; or it can be made to do so with CommonAdjust.

  * Fully modular options with cascade.

    A UI module allows editing and definition of the modular
	options, including "phantom" options that act to group
	additional items.

	When an item is defined as modular upon order, it can have
	accompanying it a series of other items in the same order
	group. The price of the options is not shown, but is added to
	the price of the master item.

  * New [profile ...] tag allows you to set directives normally
    set in catalog.cfg with a tag in the session Autoload. This
    is really the same as the current Autoload, except it is
    automatic on login/logout, faster, and leaves Autoload
    for user user.

      [profile name=profile_name tag=tag set=1 run=1 restore=1]

      name      name of profile. Needed unless restore=1.
      tag       normally not set, defaults to "default". Matches
                what is the UserDB profile.
      run       run profile code only, don't save.
      set       set profile for future only, don't run.
      restore   remove the current profile

     [profile name] will run and set by default.

  * UserDB now can set a price_level via the [profile ...]
    tag routine. Set this in catalog.cfg for dealer pricing:


		Profile dealer CommonAdjust <<EOR
	    "
		  	pricing:w5,w10:,
			;:wholesale,
			;:wholesale:mv_sku,
			;$,
			==:options
		"
		EOR
		Profile dealer NonTaxableField nontaxable

	Quotes are needed (as in all locale-style directives) unless
	you want to do a full hash set like

		Profile dealer <<EOR
	    { 
			CommonAdjust => q(
		  	pricing:w5,w10:,
			;:wholesale,
			;:wholesale:mv_sku,
			;$,
			==:options
			),

			NonTaxableField => 'nontaxable',
		}
		EOR
	
	which is also supported.

  * Added SDBM database option for those poor Solaris folks.
  
  * Added MINIVEND_ALLDBM environment check to prevent using
    unneeded modules (takes more memory).

  * Added [table-editor ...] tag which easily produces 
    editable tables. Capabilities:

		* Can edit the hash address books in userdb
		* Safe to place in user page with auto_secure=1. Generates
		  a [scratch mv_data_enable] matching the table:col1,col2,col3:key
		  you passed it.
		* Reads from CGI array or from parameters
		* Automatically reads table info from mv_metadata if
		  available
		* The following can be overridden compared to 
		  mv_metadata:
		  	
				widget
				width
				height
				help
				extra (javascript)
				filter
				pre_filter

		* Can auto-check with order_profile definitions.
		* Can append or prepend your additional form 
		  information.
		* Can generate an email copy of the data submission
		  for review. (TBA)
	
	Ready for a form widget? 8-)

  * Added new mv_form_profile variable that sets profiles with any
    action. Designed for easy checking of variables in submits.

  * Speeded import of DBI databases by placing numeric pointers
    in an array at initial config time.

  * Added ability to set defaults for empty fields at import and
    record creation time, regardless of the underlying DB, with

		Database  userdb  DEFAULT  password=please_change

	Operates exactly like COLUMN_DEF.

Interchange 4.6.1

* Added MS Excel import/export capability.

* Added new SessionType "NFS", which forces fcntl_lock/fcntl_unlock in
  SessionFile.pm (bug #76).

* Report missing DBDs at startup time by working around DBI bug that causes
  $@ to be eaten (bug #75).

* Miscellaneous bugfixes, thanks to Jean-Philippe Bouchard:
  - Fixed Data.pm bug that caused flypage problems (bug #60).
  - Fixed spreadsheet edit auto export bug (bug #59).

* Link program fixes, thanks to minivend@delionsweb.net:
  - Fixed tlink.pl LINK_PORT problem (bug #61).
  - Fixed compile_link 'nosuid' option failure (bug #66).

* Construct Something changes:
  - Fixed stock alert price problem (bug #57).
  - Fixed 'title' vs. 'description' field issues. Thanks to Steve Gertz.

* Fixed [selected] and [checked] tags to be more uniform and to support
  case-sensitive and $CGI comparisons. Documented in Tagref.pm. Also,
  "multiple" and "default" args can no longer be positional -- no big loss.

* Fixed bug that kept [item-subtotal noformat=1] from being recognized.

* [item-exec routine] now picks up $Values, etc. before a [calc] is run.

* Order.pm: routes now use a "from" parameter which sets the email From: 
  header.

* Fixes to Util.pm:
  - Prevent sprintf() from screwing up numbers in certain locales.
  - [include] now can interpret [L] if locale=1 parameter is added.

* Server.pm -- we can now accept ISINDEX queries (for what it is worth).

* Scan.pm -- fix non-interpolated tags in search profiles.

* Database tables can now reside in different directories with the 
  DIR option to the Database config parameter.

* Fixed typo ('error' vs. 'errors') in Order.pm preventing no-items
  error from being seen at checkout (bug #82). Thanks to Bas Bezemer.

* Removed some duplicated image files, reducing package size by ~ 200 KB.


Interchange 4.6.0

* Minor final changes


Interchange 4.5.8 beta release

* Documentation overhaul -- PDFs now available
* Various bugfixes
* Oracle support improved
* 'Construct' catalog improvements
* Authorize.net support


Interchange 4.5.7 beta release


Interchange 4.5.6 changes -- complete overhaul of UI

* Everything renamed to "interchange". interchange.cfg, interchange.pid,
  etc. If you keep minivend.cfg as the configuration file, the PID file
  will be minivend.pid. There should be a good level of backward
  compatibility.

* "construct" is now the default demo -- a "foundation" demo will be
  added later.

    -- Improved graphics and layout over older demos.
    -- Split ship addresses for items
    -- Shipping notices integrated
    -- Recurring order facility (doesn't yet work).
    -- PO with credit limit
    -- Merchandising cross-sells by category or item.
    -- "Others who bought this"

  The HTML rendering is kind of slow on Netscape, any help with that
  would be appreciated.

* The user interface (UI) was reorganized to make it easier to understand
  and use.

  -- All functions should now be available via menu, quicklinks should
     not be necessary.
  -- Most database table lists are HTML lists with links instead of
     the button approach.
  -- Administration console with information helpful for debug.

UI:

* Orders 
  -- list-based
  -- shipping status notices
  -- automatic check of archive box when status=shipped
  -- list-based delete and archive operations
  -- lists are sortable on multiple fields
  -- status display for individual line items
  -- change size of list with Knar UI_SZ_LIST_ORDER

* Customers
  -- list-based
  -- list-based delete and deactivate operations
  -- lists are sortable on multiple fields
  -- status display for individual line items
  -- change size of list with Knar UI_SZ_LIST_CUSTOMER

* Item editor
  -- Select list of items to delete or edit in sequence
  -- Now have different "views" for merchandising, pricing, inventory, etc.
  -- checkbox-based deletes
  -- item fields to display set with UI_ITEM_FIELDS
  -- separator fields set with UI_ITEM_BREAK
  -- cross_category field added to merchandising table

* Content
  -- Templates easier to create
  -- Editor allows change of template

* Layout
  -- button builder does on-the-fly items
  -- fixed bugs in search builder

* Merchandising
  -- new menu, includes affiliate stuff

* Reporting
  -- Fixed cast problem with PostGres reports
  -- More consistent look/feel for reports

* Administration
  -- New information screen that should help with diagnosing trouble
  -- Table select/edit now consistent with other editors
  -- Selector rows can be sorted via column, forward and reverse
  -- Table display properties can be easily edited

Core:

* Database update forms (mv_todo=set) now can set fields in multiple
  tables when there is a common key.

* Changed SpecialPage defaults for "search", "order", and "checkout"
  to reflect longstanding defaults in demo catalogs.

* Fixed bug in fixed-field (PriceField) pricing, introduced sometime
  in Minivend 4.

* Added GUESS_NUMERIC parameter to databases, which operates by checking
  field types in SQL and by looking at the import data on DBM. You can
  see this in operation in the UPS tables "Ground", etc.

* Removed auto-index of key field if POSTCREATE statement exists.

* Added some more better auto-numbering support. Still not ready
  for the UI.

* Found bug in Vend::Table::DBI->inc_field that caused a quoted value
  when really was a number.

* CSV imports now are fully as functional as others, can do indexing, numeric
  guess, etc.

* Added "value" widget type for [accessories ...].

* Added [tmp var]scratch setting[/tmp] and [scratchd var] tags to
  purge Scratch when setting/accessing variables. This can improve
  session write speed if setting a large value which will only be
  used in the current page.

* Added "tabbed" filter, and some other Filters. Now you can add
  your own filters persistently with:

    Sub <<EOS
    sub somesub { 
        $Filter{foo_to_bar} = sub {
            my $value = shift;
            $value =~ s/foo/bar/g;
            return $value;
        };
    }
    EOS
    
    or just in the current page

    [perl]
        $Filter{foo_to_bar_tmp} = sub {
            my $value = shift;
            $value =~ s/foo/bar/g;
            return $value;
        };
        return;
    [/perl]

  Thanks to Stefan Hornburg for suggestion.

* Fixed SpecialPage handling of salestax.asc, thanks to Jeff Carnahan.

* Fixed _postcode() routine in Order.pm, thanks to Brett Harrison.

* Fixed longstanding problem with demo catalog whereby the UserDB
  defined the username field as "user" but it was actually named
  "username" in the database. Changed UserDB default to "username", because
  "user" is a reserved word in some SQL databases (i.e. Postgres).

* UserDB: Removed mv_credit_card_info from B_FIELDS so that it would not
  be saved in UserDB.

* Added [counter ...] tag, with some additional capabilities over
  the old [fcounter ...] tag. Kept fcounter around in UserTag for
  compatibility with older catalogs.

* Added image copying for shared image directories (the admin).


Interchange 4.5.5 beta release


Interchange 4.5.3 beta release


Interchange 4.5.0 changes -- the start of the Tallyman merge.

* Many, many, changes and improvments to the user interface.
  Minimate is broken out again and made separate; the UI should
  have all of its functionality. See the UI online help for changes.
* LDAP support. You can now keep data in LDAP servers, with 
  normal Minivend Database connectivity. Searchable, too!
  Put in catalog.cfg:

    Database  variable variable.txt LDAP:some.servername.com
    Database  variable BIND_DN      cn=fragermk, o=catalogs, c=minivend
    Database  variable BASE_DN      o=catalogs, c=minivend
    Database  variable BIND_PW      secret

  Programmed by Mike Frager with a bit of help from Mike Heins.

* VariableDatabase now takes effect at the time of the call in catalog.cfg.
  This means you can edit your Variable settings in a database, reconfigure,
  and then use the values farther down in the configuration file.

* Order.pm: fixed multiple problems in precedence for order profiles.
  Thanks to Ton Verhagen. Also added "isbn" profile check written
  by Ton Verhagen.
* Interpolate.pm: Fixed bug in error message generation -- thanks to Dan
  Busarow.
* Config.pm: Fixed default declaration of "HOT" for memory databases,
  now should work properly as default database.
* Other changes much too numerous to mention. This will be the last
  version of this changes document; there are too many.
