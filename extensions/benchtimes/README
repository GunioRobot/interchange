benchtimes -- Simple Interchange extension to add benchmarking of catalogs

Installation:

	1. Append interchange.cfg.add to your interchange.cfg file.
	2. Append catalog.cfg.add to the catalog.cfg for any catalog
	   you want to benchmark.
	3. Copy bin/benchtimes to a place where you can execute it.
	   You could possibly have to change the first line to point
	   to a proper perl, but almost any modern perl will do.
	4. Periodically run "benchtimes CATDIR/logs/bench.log"
	   to summarize high usage. Do "perldoc bin/benchtimes"
	   for more information.
