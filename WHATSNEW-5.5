                  What's new in each version of Interchange
                       (since the version 5.4 branch)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interchange 5.5.1 released on YYYY-MM-DD.

See UPGRADE document for incompatible changes not listed here.

Core
----

* Removed odd formatting from --add entry in interchange manual page.

* Fixed a DoS exploit. A carefully crafted HTTP POST request could cause
  an Interchange page processor to hang until it's killed by Interchange's
  periodic housekeeping routine. If several of these requests are received
  in quick succession then it could be possible to disable all of the page
  processors, rendering Interchange unresponsive for a while. Fixed by
  Kevin Walsh; pointed out by Donald Alexander.

* In &Vend::Table::DBI::set_row, avoid unwanted expansion of array when we
  have PREFER_NULL fields and number of fields passed is one. Thanks to
  Peter Ajamian for the patch and investigation.

* Added Vend::Swish2 module provided by Brian Miller <brian@endpoint.com>.
  This is superior to Vend::Swish, because instead of the awkward way to
  interface with Swish-e by running the binary it uses the Swish Perl API.

  Note: This module will replace Vend::Swish after we ensure as much backward
  compatibility as possible.

* Allow specification of one additional include directory for specific
  modules, specified like this:

  Require module Vend::Swish /usr/lib/swish-e/perl

* Terminate search if mv_min_string condition isn't met.

* Make [sql-quote] list tag to work properly with multiple lines.

UserDB
------

* Fixed UserDB login issues within embedded Perl by using
  Vend::Util::string_to_ref for deserialization of carts and other 
  hashes.  

* New validchars option to customize valid characters for usernames, e.g.
  adding the + character to the list of valid characters:

  UserDB    default    validchars "-A-Za-z0-9_@.+"

UserTag
-------

* Make [save-cart] keep cart if userdb returns with an error. 

* Make [formel] call [display] on unknown types.

Filter
------

* Added "round" filter to round in floating-point-safe way, using the
  Vend::Util routine.

* Avoid ambiguity between two time formats in date_change filter.

Payment
-------

* New NetBilling module contributed by Peter Ajamian.

Jobs
----

* Added new job group db with export job to export databases offline for
  backup and version control purposes.

* Added process ID to "Run jobs" and "Finished jobs" log messages for better
  troubleshooting.

* Avoid cluttering global log file with job run messages.

UI
--

* Fix page banner in menu editor.

* Use <pre> ... </pre> instead of the obsolete <xmp> ... </xmp> element in the
  test_code admin UI page when displaying in SOURCE mode.  Don't filter
  entities when displaying in HTML mode.

Standard demo
-------------

* Fixed minor security hole of admin's session ID being exposed when placing
  an order in the admin. Found by Mark Lipscombe <markl@gasupnow.com>.

* Various special_pages/missing.html fixes:
  - Fixed broken admin 404 error page (which came from Standard).
  - Removed duplicate, sometimes-bogus MV_PREV_PAGE display.
  - Eliminated double-interpolation of page comparison.
  - Return missing special_page if there's no prod_group and catalog match.
  - Return results special_page if there is a match instead of results.html

* Updated Discover Card logo. Provided by Steve Graham.

* Increased compatibility with XHTML.

* Cleaned up splash page and fixed broken links.

* Add CVV2 support to checkout pages, images thanks to Jure Kodzoman.

SOAP
----

* Return proper SOAP error to the client instead of disclosing our faults.
