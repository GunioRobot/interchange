                  What's new in each version of Interchange
                       (since the version 5.4 branch)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interchange 5.5.1 released on YYYY-MM-DD.

See UPGRADE document for incompatible changes not listed here.

Core
----

* Fixed UserDB login issues within embedded Perl by using
  Vend::Util::string_to_ref for deserialization of carts and other 
  hashes.  

* Remove odd formatting from --add entry in interchange manual page.

* Fixed a DoS exploit. A carefully crafted HTTP POST request could cause
  an Interchange page processor to hang until it's killed by Interchange's
  periodic housekeeping routine. If several of these requests are received
  in quick succession then it could be possible to disable all of the page
  processors, rendering Interchange unresponsive for a while. Fixed by
  Kevin Walsh; pointed out by Donald Alexander.

UserTag
-------

* Make [save-cart] keep cart if userdb returns with an error. 

* Make [formel] call [display] on unknown types.

Jobs
----

* Added new job group db with export job to export databases offline for
  backup and version control purposes.
 
Standard demo
-------------

* Fixed minor security hole of admin's session ID being exposed when placing
  an order in the admin. Found by Mark Lipscombe <markl@gasupnow.com>.
