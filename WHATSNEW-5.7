See UPGRADE document for a list of incompatible changes.


Interchange 5.7.0 under development.

Search
------

* mv_force_coordinate (fc) added to force coordinated search.  Normally, when
the number of search field does not match the number of search strings (specs),
coordinated mode is automatically turned off. With 'fc', number of search specs
is adjusted to match the number of search fields, either by filling the array
with last-set mv_searchspec, or by trimming excess values. Useful when you want
to search for one string in multiple fields in coordinated mode.

* remove trailing whitespace from text file headers 

UserTag
-------

* srcliteral attribute added to [button] tag. Setting srcliteral avoids the image existence check for the src attribute. 

* [run-profile] removes automatically generated profiles only.

OrderCheck
----------

* added ISBN-13 support to isbn order check and relocated it to code/OrderCheck.
