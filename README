Here is the quick installation summary:

gzip -dc interchange-4.7.?.tar.gz | tar xvf -
cd interchange-4.7.?
./configure

Then you will need to make your first Interchange catalog. See the
section 'DEMO' below.

Remember to check http://developer.akopia.com/ for documentation and
help from other users if you have any trouble.

There is a demo catalog included called 'foundation'.

To install the demo, go to the directory where you installed Interchange
(default is "interchange" in your home directory, /usr/local/interchange
for root installations, or /usr/lib/interchange for RPM installations)
and run:

    bin/makecat

Follow the prompts and after restarting the Interchange server you
should be able to access the demo catalog.

Please note that some functionality (notably the reporting features)
may not be available if you are not using an SQL database such as
MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Visit http://demo.akopia.com/ to see a live demo on our servers.

Interchange is regularly tested on Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris. It
has also been used on OpenBSD, Digital UNIX/Tru64, SCO, AIX, and other
Unix ports. It should work on any Unix with Perl 5.005 or higher and
the necessary Perl modules.

Apache with suEXEC:

vlink/UNIX socket mode will not work well unless you do the install as
a normal user. If you are going to support multiple users, you must use
tlink/INET mode.
