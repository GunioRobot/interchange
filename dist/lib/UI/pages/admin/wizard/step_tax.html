<table><tr><td width=500>
<P>
Enter your tax calculation information. This tax calculation information is
used to determine the amount of tax to be charged. In the <b>Tax
location</b> field, enter the state in which you are selling. In the <b>Tax
rate</b> field, enter the tax percentage used in that state. This value
should be entered as a decimal. For example, 5% sales tax would be entered
as .05. Check the <b>Tax Shipping</b> box if shipping cost should be
included in tax calculation. More complex tax calculations can be configured
using the Interchange Administration Tool. The required fields are displayed
in <b>Bold</b>.
<p>
Sales tax settings allows you to specify what locations (<STRONG>TAX
LOCATION</STRONG>) you are required to collect sales tax from. For
example, if your company is located in California, you may be required to
collect sales tax of 7.25% (<STRONG>TAX RATE</STRONG>) for certain items
that you sell to customers in California. Interchange will determine at
checkout, where your customer is located. It does this by checking the
"ship to" information that they fill in. If the customer is located in
a <STRONG>TAX LOCATION</STRONG> that you have specified, the amount of
the order is multiplied by the <STRONG>TAX RATE</STRONG> that you have
specified and is added to the&nbsp;cost of the products ordered. Some
companies are required to collect sales tax in more than one state.
</P>
<P>
Once your catalog is installed, you will be able to easily add more
locations using the Interchange administration tool. If you are not
required to collect sales tax (please refer to the appropriate friendly,
helpful taxing authority for your area), leave these fields blank.
