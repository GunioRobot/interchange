You can select how customers will navigate your Interchange site.
There are a variety of navigation layout's to choose from,
pick the one that best suits the needs of your catalog.

<p>

<input type="radio" value="foundation"><b>Foundation</b> - This is your
standard Interchange navigation, with the menubar on top,
the category list on the left, content in the middle, and sells on
the right.

<p>

<input type="radio" value="cattop"><b>Category Top</b> - A popular
navigation layout on the web, with a few main categories on top,
and the menubar switched over to the left.

<p>
<input type="submit">
