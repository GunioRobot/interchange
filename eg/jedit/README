What does it do?
================
The Interchange jEdit mode file will allow syntax highlighting for "most" interchange needs.
It supports highlighting of HTML, CSS, Javascript, SGML Entities, Perl, and ITL.
You can also force jEdit to highlist UserTags, ActionMaps, etc... by explicitly setting the mode
to "interchange", it will not automagically switch to this mode upon opening the file.

What does it not do?
====================
The Interchange jEdit mode file will not highlight configuration files properly.
